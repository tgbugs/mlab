#see odML terminologies for ideas for some of this
#somehow this seems like it is about to be integrated with the expman...
#not reinventing the wheel, rather important here
#this should contain pointers to things in the rest of the world, we have google/internet after all, though in some ways this might make filing and keeping track of things easier...

#FIXME this framework should be EXTENSIBLE NOT COMPLETE
#AND it should be extensible based on MINIMAL STANDARDS allowing for other things too

#cull these and figure out what goes IN the database and HOW it goes in
#the other stuff should be considered too meta

standards #should be used to determine the minimal columns for a table

    required for a standard
    REQUIRED FOR REPLICATION
    needed to interpret raw data
        file format
    needed for analysis
    needed to understand the data
    needed to answer a hypothesis
    needed to fit data into the current literature

    the thing that experiments are grouped under

experiment

hypothesis
    heirarchical (yeah, look at dat file system >_<)
